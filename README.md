# file_editor

Have a client file full of wierd and useless variables?  Need to change all occurances of a misspelled name?  Want to mess with someone's thesis?  This is the module for you!

+ edit_file will move through a given file (with delimiter, if useful) and find all near matches (list) and/or exact matches (list) and write a new file with the values replaced with a specified one.
+ edit_all_files will do the same thing, but to all files of given filtype within a directory



This is super useful for cleaning up files dumped from STATA and other sources that you want to clean before reading or pushing to a database.


Yaaay! Give me feedback please.
